## Stata integration with ODK

This repository is aimed at showing how we can use Stata to automate data management processes when collecting with [Open Data Kit](https://getodk.org/) (ODK).

The goal is to show code example that are easily modified to work with (almost) any project using ODK.

### What this repo contains

This repository contains do-files and a few csv files used for project configuration. 
The do-files are designed to perform the following tasks:

* [Downloading data automatically from an ODK Aggregate instance](https://github.com/benjaminFaguer/Stata_ODK/blob/master/Download_data_from_ODK_using_Briefcase.do). âœ… 
* [Label and shape the data from `csv` to `dta` using the Stata program `odkmeta`](https://github.com/benjaminFaguer/Stata_ODK/blob/master/Label_data_with_ODKmeta.do). âœ…
* Merge all forms in a comprehensive dataset. ðŸš§


### How to use

You can either download/clone the repository and edit it to fit your needs locally, or fork it to keep track of your changes on Github.
